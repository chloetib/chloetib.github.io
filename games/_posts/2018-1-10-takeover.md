Takeover Trail is a mobile game released for Android and iOS in the fall if 2016. The game is based around choosing a dictator, and taking control of neighboring countries. On this game, I helped with multiple aspects of development leading into the version 3 launch. I helped mock up and design total UI revamp. In other aspects of design, I helped to formulate a layout for the Skill Tree. Also, I've created documentation on the different ways UI, and a skill tree, can add to the variability of the game. Art-wise, I have created 24 icons for the new skill tree. I have also created many other icons and placeholders for future implementation.
