S-W-I-T-C-H was created by Yukon Wainczak and I during a 24-hour game jam. The Becker College IGDA held a Game Jam where the theme was "Experiment". So, we decided to allow the player to experiment with level design in a silly platforming game. The game placed 2nd overall and was on the front page of Newgrounds. I was a designer and artist on the title.
