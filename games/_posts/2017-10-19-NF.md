  A final project for an Introduction to Game Design Course. The game is based off of simple movement mechanics where you, an angry trucker, get back at all the frogs who have wronged you.

Not Frogger was a game created for the class Introduction to Game Design. The game is based off the idea of an inverse Frogger, where the player would be a truck, that runs over cartoon-y frogs. I was the Lead Artist of the team. I created over 15 3D models for the game. I also textured some of the models, and made the logo and menu screens.
