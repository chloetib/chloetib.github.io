Colosseum Coach is an Android and IOS game by MassDiGI. It is a strategy game where you train gladiators to fight increasingly difficult monsters. In my time working on this game, I created over 70 assets. These include backgrounds, weapons, shields, armor, hats, gladiators, backgrounds, and marketing assets. I was Lead Artist for the Spring 2017 team.
