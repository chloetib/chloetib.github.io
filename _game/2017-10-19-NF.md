Not Frogger was a game created for the class Introduction to Game Design. The game is based off the idea of an inverse Frogger, where the player would be a truck, that runs over cartoon-y frogs. I was the Lead Artist of the team. I created over 15 3D models for the game. I also textured some of the models, and made the logo and menu screens.
