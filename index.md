# Under Construction!
##About
###Hi! If youâ€™re here, you probably want to know more about me. So, here are some things you should know!
###I have always been the kid who was into technology. I was curious about the ever-advancing technologies of the time. This curiosity very quickly led me to have a passion for all things Video Games.
###I have played video games for as long as I can remember, starting with the Sega Genesis. Quickly, I fell in love with the many stories and characters I met while gaming, and my imagination led me to want to create worlds of my own.
###Constantly drawing these worlds led me to discovering the career of a Game Artist. So I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Interactive Media, with a concentration in Game Art. Here is where you will find the many creations of mine, from sprites to full blown game projects.
