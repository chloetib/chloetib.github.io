For my 3D Modeling final, we were tasked with modeling a full character. So, I decided to Model Handsome Jack from the Borderlands Games. The model was sculpted within Sculptris. Later, I retopologized the mesh in Maya, and added in all the clothing. After that, I textured it in Substance Painter, and Rendered it in Unity.
